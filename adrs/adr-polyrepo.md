# Selection of Polyrepo Approach for Microservices Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Selection of the polyrepo approach for microservices architecture. Utilizing the polyrepo approach, which involves maintaining separate code repositories for each microservice.

## Decision

- Microservices Isolation: In a microservices architecture, one of the key principles is the isolation of individual services. Maintaining separate repositories for each microservice enables full isolation of code, ensuring that changes in one service do not directly impact others.
- Immediate Deployment and Scalability: With polyrepo, each microservice can be deployed and scaled independently. This is crucial in a dynamic business environment where different application components may require varying levels of scalability and independent deployment.
- Simplified Configuration and Versioning Management: With polyrepo, managing configuration and versioning becomes simpler. Each microservice has its own set of configurations and version history, facilitating change tracking and issue debugging.
- Team Collaboration: Having separate repositories for each microservice facilitates collaboration between teams. Each team can focus on its area of responsibility without interfering with the code of other services.
- Risk Distribution: In the event of a failure or issues with one microservice, the others can continue to operate without hindrance. With polyrepo, the risk associated with the failure of one service is limited only to that service, increasing the overall system resilience.


## Consequences

- Increased Complexity in Managing Multiple Repositories: Polyrepo requires automated deployment, testing, and management processes, which may introduce additional complexity in development workflows.
- Need for Maintaining Consistency Across Repositories: Ensuring consistency across different microservices requires appropriate tools and processes.
