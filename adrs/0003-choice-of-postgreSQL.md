## Context

PostgreSQL was selected as the relational database at the outset of my web application project due to the nature of the data and the need for managing complex relationships between entities. As the project has progressed, it's essential to formally document and reaffirm this decision, considering the relational nature of the data and the importance of maintaining data integrity through structured relationships.

## Decision

I reaffirm my decision to use PostgreSQL as my relational database. The relational model provided by PostgreSQL allows to define and manage relationships between different data entities effectively. This decision aligns with my project's requirements for robust data management and ensures consistency and integrity across various data sets.

## Consequences

By sticking with PostgreSQL as my relational database, I ensure the continued ability to model and maintain complex relationships between data entities. This facilitates data consistency, integrity, and efficiency in querying related data sets. Additionally, leveraging PostgreSQL's relational capabilities simplifies future development efforts by providing a structured approach to data management.
