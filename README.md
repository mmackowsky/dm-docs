# DeviceMinder docs

## Description
<p>
This repository has documents named ADR (Archicheture Decision Record) that present the decision I have made in the process of developing the 
ADRs explain the context of the problem to be solved, decisions that could fix it and consequences of implemented solutions.
Every document is numbered in order of creation.
